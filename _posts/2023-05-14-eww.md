# Eww bar

Barless is great. But sometimes you want direct readings without extra steps (to observe a long script, or just tired?). After writing a small GUI for [pixelmosh](https://github.com/charlesrocket/pixelmosh), I wanted to add some GTK to my desktop as well. And [eww](https://github.com/elkowar/eww/) is a fantastic instrument to do so. There is no GTK4 yet, but I managed to port 100% of my old layout with all projected improvements.

My dependency tree is not perfect, but it works while overlapping WM's requirements/dotfiles. A single Perl script sounds like an efficient goal (just `defpoll` for now).
