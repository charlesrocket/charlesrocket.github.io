# BTC Lightning Node on Raspberry Pi

![RPi MBP](/assets/images/rpi-mbp.jpg)

**RaspiBlitz** (by @rootzoll) is the fastest and cheapest way to get your own Lightning Node running on a RaspberryPi with a nice LCD.

Use [this](https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz/blob/master/README.md#hardware-needed) guide to build and spin up your node.

If you are confident in your wifi network - use `sudo raspi-config` to setup wireless connection ([ref](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/wireless-cli.md)).
