# Medium format system - Daily
I am really behind on this one, but better late than never, right? Back in Brooklyn I got lucky to land an internship with Robert Grima who introduced me to Capture One. That software would be a power tool for digital image production of the best example if we are talking about the colour. Persistence and the amount of attention it throws on how you work with colours is astonishing if you are a PS professional. But there's a reason for it - that software is built to work with 16 bits of colour. This is pretty much what I would think of if you ask me a definition of medium format. But that also be wrong since there's now Fuji medium format cameras with 8 bits of colour. All DSLRs are 8 bits of colour due to their size. They also have a protective layer on the sensor, while all medium format digital backs don't. Physically, more glass between the subject and the sensor/film equals more distortion. There's also a commercial factor, that is not allowing low budget cameras to be able to produce a magazine-like quality of output. But you can find photographs from the previous century that would show more details per inch than any modern DSLR. These would be photographs from the large format. I am not mentioning the Bayer layer and BW versions of DSLR/digital backs since I don't have hours behind working with them. Phase One, the company behind Capture One, is the current leader in digital medium format. Their digital backs used to be superior. There was an ad with an elephant standing on Phase One P series digital back. It gets dark now, tho, since now you have to ship your equipment monthly back to Phase One due to very low quality of current builds. So let's talk about vintage hardware. The image below was taken with Phase One H20 digital back that was produced back in 2001.

Lenses and camera are Mamiya (RZ67 Pro body with Phase One plate was my set) from 1986. You can see the advantage of 16 bits and what they do in the gradual reflection of colours. It's not about pixels, it's about the colour.

This is an example of what you can achieve with some vintage equipment and Capture One. You can score H20 on ebay for around $500 while a decent DSLR kit with the glass would bite around $3k. The trade-off is weight and mobility. H20 series are tethered cameras, so you will have to carry fireware-compatible laptop on your back along with the camera and lenses. It's totally worth it if you ask me [Spxxk](https://www.flickr.com/photos/charlesrocket/29239915310). What I do recommend is getting a proper shade for the display - might be hard to read the monitor under heavy sunlight (learned the hard way [bk walls](https://www.flickr.com/photos/charlesrocket/27429428966)). If you want to drop the cable - consider Phase One P series - full kit could be assembled with less than $4k on ebay if you don't care about the resolution and can find cheap Mamiya body. It's getting harder on this topic so I might be a little incorrect on the price, but it's still way cheaper than spending top cash on just DSLR glass. Yes, just the glass! Working with medium format cameras really pushing you to appreciate the film and learn how to play with light and the equipment, not settings and software (RZ67 with the film back [Chelsea](https://www.instagram.com/p/BEMHWo4J7yP/)).
