# Sway and FreeBSD

I started to migrate from macOS back in December 2020 - `kext` "deprecation" was the [last](https://twitter.com/patrickwardle/status/1318437929497235457) drop. And we won, [eventually](https://twitter.com/patrickwardle/status/1349488392732491776). But the fact that you had to fight for it, and the internal reaction - everything now is just screaming theres nothing left of what used to be **OSX**. Not to mention no macOS Server and no Pro. That is it. So...

First builds on `FBSD13B1` on my laptop were not as smooth as today - you had to tweak CPU, network, boot, peripheral drivers, etc. Fun but not really as efficient as it could be. A few months later in the final `FBSD13` the difference was overcoming. I mean touchscreen-out-of-the-box overcoming. Then `sway`'s stability improved dramatically and I started working on my [freebsd-station](https://github.com/charlesrocket/freebsd-station) playbook. After another few months, I managed to polish the layout and started porting the environment. I indeed forgot that I don't need minutes for the IDE to load. No more web-based Atom and parasitic `brew`. With macOS, it would still be a better option (machine) for `Capture One` tasks, but it's not like I will be building another medium format studio rig. So I can drop the mouse as well.

So far I ported 100% of my active macOS environment,
