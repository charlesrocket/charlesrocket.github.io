# Codebase backup utility

![dorst cli screenshot](/assets/images/dorst_cli-v0.8.png)

  `dorst` is a source code backup manager. Right now, it only works with `git`, and its purpose is to mirror repositories into a local (or remote) destination. `ssh-agent` is supported along with `gitconfig`'s credential helper. I am still working on CLI concurrency, but GUI feels completed:

GTK is fun to work with - I feel that this would probably drive both interfaces into something bigger than a backup manager. So far, it got responsive status outputs, authorization, simple target management and a filter. I use `Working Copy` daily, so UI's similarity is no surprise, though not sure if this is my writing or GTK's guidance.

The latest version is available via `cargo install dorst --features gui` (drop the `features` flag to install CLI only).
